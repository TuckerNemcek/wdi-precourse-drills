<h1>About me</h1>

<p> I am a 24 year old guy who decided he did not want to work in retail anymore. I am really excited about this class and think it will open up a whole new realm of possibilites for me. I am looking forward to having  career instead of just working jobs.</p>

<p>I was born in Alaska but have lived most of my life in Minnesota. I then moved to Wisconsin but then realized it was pretty much the same as Minnesota.I threw a dart at a map and it landed in the trash can, so I went to Florida.</p>

<p>After escaping Florida I made it out to Boulder Colorado and have been out here since February 2017. What a place. We got mountains, we got a groovy atmosphere, the people are chill and all look like supermodels. I really like it here!</p>

<p>I suck at Frisbee Golf, but love to play, so hmu if you want to play a few rounds!</p>
